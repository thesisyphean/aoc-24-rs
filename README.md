# Advent of Code 2024 in Rust

## Description

These are my solutions to [2024's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) written in Rust. I'm using Rust because I'm moderately confident with the basics, but I haven't used it in a while and I'm rus... uh... out of practice. I'm also hoping to use more advanced Rust techniques that I'm not so comfortable with.<br />
Some parts of this project's README were inspired by [this README](https://github.com/jhrcook/advent-of-code-2023-rust).
